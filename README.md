## Personas 

### Persona 1:

Name: Christopher

Age: 27

Occupation: Front-end freelancer

Dreams and goals: Be the next Mark Zuckerberg

Personality: 

“A bit introverted but yet not”
Christopher is a bit introverted in the sense that he only likes to talk when the subject interests him, get him speaking about his brand new idea for an app and he’ll talk for hours.

“Creative and driven”
He dreams about being the next developer superstar and always is always looking for the way to achieve this, he digs himself into ideas and always tries to be on top of the latest programming features to be able to discuss them with his pears.

“Hard to sit still”
In the same sense that he doesn’t stay on an idea for an app for longe if he sees no potential in it, he does not stay on an app or with a language if it doesn’t convince him to do so quickly.








### Persona 2

Name: Gregory

Age: 35

Occupation: Full-time employed full stack web developer

Dreams and goals: One day being able to code whatever makes him happy. And financial security of course.

Personality:
	
“Lives on the safe side but wishes he didn’t”
Gregory in many cases tries to take the safe route which is why he has a full time job. 	He does however dream about coding whatever makes him happy but does not want 	to take to big of a risk for it.

“Not so creative but very smart”
He isn’t to creative so coming up with brand new ideas himself would be kinda hard, 	he is on the other hand very good at both programming and problem solving in
general, so whatever you can imagine, he can probably work out how to build it for you.

“Productivity first”
He believes that you should not spend too much time thinking about what you want to do, it’s better to just try and see what works, this way of working makes him very productive but he can in many cases be perceived as  a bit short with his patience with people because of this.
